作为大数据开发, 日常往往以写SQL为主, 阅读一些经典的论文不仅可以开拓视野, 也可以更好的理解大数据技术的来龙去脉.

也希望能够写一些东西记录一下

Konwledge is a skyscraper. You can take a shortcut with a fragile foundation of memorization,
or build slowly upon a steel frame of understanding.

GFS differrent points:

-   Component failures are the norm rather than the exception
    -   Constant monitoring
    -   error detection
    -   fault tolerance
    -   automatic recovery
-   files are huge by traditional standards
-   most files are mutated by appending new data rather than overwritting existing data

once writting the files are read only
